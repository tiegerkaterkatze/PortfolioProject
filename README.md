# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
Most of us had been suffering from credit card fraud in the recent years. Detecting fraudulent transactions are critical for many applications.  

## DATA
This fraud detection project solution code will use the [credit card fraud detection dataset created by the Machine Learning Group - ULB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). 
It contains transactions made in September 2013 by cardholders from Europe. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions that occured over 2 days. Out of those transactions 492 are fraudulent. 

## MODEL 
I am using a decision tree for the fraud detection due to its easy understandablity. 

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
The depth of the tree is one of the hyperparameters for this project. Currently I hjave achieved best results with depth of tree of 4.

## RESULTS
This is a simple model yet achieves good accuracy.
