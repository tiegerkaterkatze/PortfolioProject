# Datasheet Credit card fraud dataset

Anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine.
Please find the full description of the dataset on Kaggle.
[Credit card fraud detection dataset created by the Machine Learning Group - ULB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 
To tran machine learning model to prevent fraud so that customers do not get charged for items that they did not purchase.
- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?
Machine learning group - ULB, part of a reseaarch collaboration with WorldLine and Machine learning group
 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?
Credit card transactions 
- How many instances of each type are there? 
29 Decimal columns and 2 integer coluns
28 features, amount and time and class (fraudulent or not)
- Is there any missing data?
No
- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
No

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired?
 As part of a reseach collaboration of Wordline and the Machine Learning Group.
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
Unknown
- Over what time frame was the data collected?
September 2013

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
No
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 

 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
Sample projects for machine learning
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
No
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
Unknown

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
Yes, uploaded to Kaggle
